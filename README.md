# Customer_Churn_Prediction_Using_Python_and_EDA
Customer churn is a significant challenge in industries like telecommunications, where retaining customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. This project leverages data science techniques to:

.Analyze patterns in customer behavior.
.Identify features that contribute most to churn.
.Provide actionable insights for customer retention strategies.
The dataset includes various service-related and demographic features, such as:
  Demographics: SeniorCitizen, gender, etc.
  Service Usage: PhoneService, MultipleLines, InternetService, StreamingTV, StreamingMovies, etc.
  Optional Features: OnlineSecurity, OnlineBackup, DeviceProtection, etc.
  Churn Status: Indicates whether a customer left or stayed.
Subplot Analysis:
  Countplots show churn distribution across key categorical variables, highlighting distinct patterns for different services.
  Stacked bar charts with percentages reveal relative churn proportions within each category, making it easy to identify high-risk groups.
